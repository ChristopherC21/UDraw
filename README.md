Android Drawing Application — Formal Project Outline
I. Project Description

A. Project Title: Android Drawing Application
B. Overview:
1. The Android Drawing Application is a mobile app that allows users to draw freely on a canvas using touch interactions.
2. Users can adjust brush size, change colors, undo strokes, clear the canvas, and save drawings as image files.
3. The app is designed for creativity, note-taking, sketching, and educational use.
C. Objective:
- To design and implement a simple yet effective mobile drawing platform showcasing Android development best practices in user interaction, layout design, and data management.

II. Problem Addressing

A. Problem Statement:
- Many mobile users lack a lightweight and easy-to-use drawing tool for sketches and notes without unnecessary complexity or large storage demands.
B. Proposed Solution:
1. Provide a minimalistic drawing tool that enables users to draw, edit, and save sketches quickly.
2. Implement an intuitive user interface suitable for both beginners and professionals.
C. Benefits:
- Encourages creativity and productivity.
- Provides a platform for visual communication and design prototypes.
- Offers a practical example of mobile UI/UX and canvas rendering for developers and students.

III. Platform

A. Target Platform: Android OS
B. Programming Language: Kotlin
C. Development Environment: Android Studio (latest stable release)
D. Android SDK Version:
- Minimum SDK: 24 (Android 7.0)
- Target SDK: 34 (Android 14)
E. Build System: Gradle

IV. Front-End and Back-End Support

A. Front-End Components:
1. User Interface (UI): XML-based layouts designed with ConstraintLayout and Material Design components.
2. Drawing Canvas: Custom DrawingView class that handles touch input and rendering via the Android Canvas and Paint APIs.
3. Controls: Buttons for undo, clear, save, and color change; SeekBar for brush size adjustment.

B. Back-End Components:
1. Logic Layer: Kotlin classes for handling drawing strokes, paths, color updates, and file saving.
2. Storage:
- Internal app-specific external directory for saving PNG files.
- Optional integration with MediaStore for saving images to device gallery (future update).
3. Architecture:
- Follows separation of concerns (UI handled in MainActivity, rendering in DrawingView).

V. Functionality

A. Core Features:
1. Freehand touch-based drawing on a canvas.
2. Undo last stroke.
3. Clear all drawings.
4. Change brush color and size dynamically.
5. Save drawing as a PNG file to local storage.

B. Optional Enhancements (Future Implementation):
1. Color picker dialog.
2. Eraser mode.
3. Redo functionality.
4. Layered drawing support.
5. Gallery export and sharing capabilities.

VI. Design (Wireframes)

A. Main Layout Overview:
1. Top Section: Drawing canvas (DrawingView) occupying the majority of the screen.
2. Bottom Toolbar:
- Buttons: Undo, Clear, Save, Color.
- SeekBar: Adjust brush thickness.

B. Wireframe Representation (Simplified ASCII Concept):

C. Design Principle:
- Clean, minimal interface focused on ease of use and functionality.
- Responsive layout optimized for both phones and tablets.
- Consistent color scheme using Material Design guidelines.
